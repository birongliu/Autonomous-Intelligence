# Autonomous Intelligence

Autonomous Intelligence is an open-source research project by [Anote](https://anote.ai/) that enables collaborative multi-agent AI systems. The framework provides the infrastructure to create, deploy, and coordinate specialized AI agents that can operate both independently and together in dynamic environments. Agents communicate through defined pathways while an orchestrator manages task distribution, ensuring efficient execution and seamless collaboration. This architecture allows the system to adapt to changing conditions, automatically selecting the best agents, tools, and workflows to tackle complex problems. To learn more, see the video demo below:

### Core Components

| Component                    | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestrator**             | Central hub for task assignment, execution, and monitoring. Manages agent interactions and refines workflows dynamically. |
| **Agent**                    | An autonomous unit programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents. |
| **Task**                     | A specific assignment completed by an agent, providing all necessary details like description, tools, and responsibilities. |
| **Crew**                     | A collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Crews define strategies for task execution and agent collaboration. |
| **Workflows**  | Frameworks for agent collaboration. This includes sequential tasks that are executed in an orderly progression, or hierarchical tasks are managed via a structured chain of command|
| **Models** | Backbone of intelligent agents, enabling capabilities like natural language understanding and reasoning. Includes models like GPT, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, and Llama that are Optimized for complex workflows. |
| **Tools**                     | A skill or function agents use to perform actions, that includes capabilities like search, computer use, data extraction, file uploading and advanced interactions. |

### Use Cases

Within the [Agent Registry](https://anote.ai/community/agents), we have added many domain specific agents. Here are a few example use cases:

### Example Use Case: AI Assisted Outreach

1. **Input Query**: The user provides a task, e.g., “Reach out to a list of 10,000 New York-based heads of AI who work in mid-sized finance companies.”
2. **Data Collection**: The orchestrator leverages an AI-powered data foundation and the web to source the most reliable leads. The agent processes the input criteria to generate a list, such as Job Title: Data Scientist, Industry: Technology, Company Size: >1,000, Location: United States
3. **Agent Workflow**: The AI workflow processes the input by applying specific rules and guidelines to filter the data. Agents collaborate to refine the lead list and create tailored email drafts for each contact.
4. **Email and List Generation**: The system outputs a curated list of leads, including contact information, along with tailored email content ready for automated delivery.
5. **Automation**: Emails are automatically sent to the generated list of leads. The system tracks progress, showing the number of emails sent and responses received daily.
6. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback is incorporated to improve the lead generation process, refine email drafts, or adjust selection criteria for future tasks.

### Set Up

The preferred local startup path is now:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
docker compose up --build
```

That starts the frontend, backend, MySQL, Redis, and Tika together.

If Docker is installed but not running, start Docker Desktop first or `docker compose up` will fail before the app boots.

For native local development and testing instructions, see [`CODEBASE_SETUP.md`](/Users/natanvidra/Workspace/Autonomous-Intelligence/CODEBASE_SETUP.md).

### Publishing

#### VS Code Extension

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/anote-vscode-package
mkdir -p /tmp/anote-vscode-package
rsync -a packages/vscode/ /tmp/anote-vscode-package/
cd /tmp/anote-vscode-package
npm install
npm run build
npx vsce login Anote
npx vsce publish
```

#### npm CLI Package

```bash
cd packages/cli
npm login          # enter your npm credentials
npm publish --access public      # builds automatically via prepublishOnly
```

#### Troubleshooting

If cloning the private repository fails, authenticate GitHub CLI first:

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```
